# Brent

Brent is a discord bot for reporting the most recent crowd-sourced location of [The Goons](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/The_Goons) in Escape From Tarkov.

[Knight](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Knight), [Big Pipe](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Pipe), and [Birdeye](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Birdeye) must be located and eliminated by the player to complete the quest [Stray Dogs](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Stray_Dogs). 

Unlike other bosses, the Goon Squad rotates between a couple maps. Every few hours the spawn rates adjust to "move" them from one map in their rotation to another. This bot attempts to report the latest sighting across several community-run crowd sourcing programs.
