# Brent

Brent is a discord bot for reporting the most recent crowd-sourced location of [The Goons](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/The_Goons) in Escape From Tarkov.

[Knight](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Knight), [Big Pipe](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Pipe), and [Birdeye](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Birdeye) must be located and eliminated by the player to complete the quest [Stray Dogs](https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Stray_Dogs). Every few hours the Goons Squad's spawn rates adjust to "move" them from one map to another. This bot reports the latest sighting reported across several crowd-sourced community trackers.
